Linux boot wrapper with FDT support
===================================

The following files need to be linked into the boot wrapper directory:

dtc			 - point to <linux-build-dir>/scripts/dtc/dtc
vexpress-v2p-aarch64.dts - point to <linux-src-dir>/arch/arm64/boot/dts/vexpress-v2p-aarch64.dts
vexpress-v2m-rs1.dtsi	 - point to <linux-src-dir>/arch/arm64/boot/dts/vexpress-v2m-rs1.dtsi
skeleton.dtsi		 - point to <linux-src-dir>/arch/arm64/boot/dts/skeleton.dtsi

Alternatively, you may specify the paths for dtc and the main dts file
on the make command-line. For example:

make DTC=<path-to-dtc> FDT_SRC=<linux-src-dir>/arch/arm64/boot/dts/vexpress-v2p-aarch64.dtsi
